## Master Prompt Template

Use this base template for all exercise images:

```
Simple line drawing illustration of a gender-neutral human figure [DOING ACTION].
Clean minimal style like a physical therapy instruction diagram.
Black lines on pure white background.
Anatomically accurate body proportions.
No shading, no colors, no text, no labels.
Side view / front view / back view [CHOOSE ONE].
The figure should clearly show [KEY POSITION DETAILS].
```

## Prompt Consistency Tips

1. **Always include**: "Simple line drawing", "gender-neutral", "white background", "no text"
2. **Specify view**: Side view works best for most exercises
3. **Describe the key position**: What makes this position correct
4. **One figure per image**: Avoid multiple figures unless showing progression
5. **Regenerate if needed**: DALL-E 3 may need 2-3 attempts for best results

## Quality Checklist

After generating, verify:
- [ ] Anatomically plausible position
- [ ] Clear enough to understand the exercise
- [ ] Consistent style with other images
- [ ] No text or artifacts
- [ ] Figure is complete (no cut-off limbs)

# Batch Generation Workflow

1. **Generate in batches**: Do all images for one exercise before moving to the next
2. **Review immediately**: Check each image before generating the next
3. **Note variations**: If a prompt works better with small changes, update this guide
4. **Consistent session**: Try to generate related images in the same session for consistency

# Post-Processing (Optional)

If needed, simple post-processing can be done:
- Crop to focus on the figure
- Resize to consistent dimensions
- Convert to PNG if not already
- Remove any unwanted artifacts

Tools: Preview (Mac), Paint.NET (Windows), GIMP (cross-platform)
